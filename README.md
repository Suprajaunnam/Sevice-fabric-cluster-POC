# Sevice-fabric-cluster-POC
 This POC will explain how to collect App Insights data when a website is deployed in Service fabric Cluster. Here in this POC I used stateless service fabric code and I deployed this code in five node Service Fabric Cluster. I configured App Insights settings in application manifest files as well as in the Json settings. I wrote the code in application.cs file to collect the pipeline data. Once the application starts running in the Service fabric cluster it will gives the pipeline code to inject the health information of the web application and also sends the custom information to App Insights.
